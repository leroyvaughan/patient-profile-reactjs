# Patient Profile App

## DISCLAIMER: This is a sample of how I code.  You can try to use this repo, but without the database it's gonna be useless to you.

So...this code is a sample application of the type of coding I do for YGEIA GROUP and our @HomeVitals software.

I ingested Epic and Cerner api patient data into a MongoDb database and then wrote a bunch of NodeJs code around that data to display the patient profiles that were built.

Using iHealth Sensor Devices, sensor readings were taken while logged in as a specific patient on the patient portal.  That is where the Vitals/Sensor Data comes from.

This data was trimmed down and anonymized for purposes of this project, but the theory is the same: Sensor Data is displayed in charts along with key elements of each patient:

- Allergies
- Conditions
- Immunizations
- Medications
- Procedures



## **of note: ReactJs front end has not been started on yet.  This is version 0.123.




Here's the running app online:
